# SimpleTropical


This is an implementation of [tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_semiring) (min-plus) arithmetic in Julia.

> **Changes in version 0.3**: There are a variety of minor changes. For example, some errors previously thrown as assertion errors are now thrown as domain errors. (These are technically breaking changes.) <p>More significantly is the introduction of the `TropicalPolynomial` type. 


Documentation is now hosted [here](https://docs.juliahub.com/General/SimpleTropical/).
